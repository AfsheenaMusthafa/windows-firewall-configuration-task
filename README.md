## üõ°Ô∏è How Windows Firewall Filters Traffic

Windows Firewall works by applying a set of **rules** that decide whether to allow or block network traffic.

- **Inbound rules** control data coming *into* the system from the network.  
- **Outbound rules** control data leaving the system.  
- Each rule can be based on parameters such as **IP address**, **port number**, or **protocol** (TCP/UDP).  
- When a packet matches a rule, the firewall either **allows** or **blocks** it depending on the rule‚Äôs configuration.  
- If no specific rule matches, the default action for that profile (Domain, Private, Public) is applied.
